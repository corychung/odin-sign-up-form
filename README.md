# The Odin Project: Sign-up Form

This is my sign-up form for The Odin Project. To be honest, this section of the course was a bit of a slog to get through, but I think the project itself was fun. There was a LOT of prior reading for this section though, especially the forms section alone took a long time to get through. But it makes sense now, because forms are such an important (and info-dense) area of website development and there were a lot of points to get across.
